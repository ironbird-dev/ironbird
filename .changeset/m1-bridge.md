The in-app bridge. `startBridge` connects a dev build to the daemon over WebSocket, answers `describe`, `dispatch`, `getState`, `waitFor`, `settle`, `events`, `fakeControl`, `fakeCalls`, and snapshots, settles after each dispatch by waiting for tracked effects and two animation frames, reconnects with backoff, and is inert outside dev builds. Core now exports `parseCondition`, `conditionHolds`, and `deepEqual` (moved from `@ironbird/cli`, which re-exports them), and a throwing subscriber in `EventRecorder`, `Tracker`, or `Target` no longer prevents later subscribers from running. `ironbird verify-bundle <path...>` scans release output for the bridge marker without a daemon and exits 1 listing the files that contain it.
