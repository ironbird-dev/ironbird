`@ironbird/core` no longer loads zod when it is imported. The command registry produces JSON Schema through each schema's own `toJSONSchema` method, so zod is a type-only import in core, and the core build now fails if any entry imports zod at load time. The zod peer dependency floor moves from `^4.0.0` to `^4.2.0`, the first release with that method; `@ironbird/cli` and the checkout example follow. CLI client commands such as `state`, `status`, `send`, and `wait` start faster because importing core no longer evaluates zod.
