## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 78490e8: `@ironbird/core` no longer loads zod when it is imported. The command registry produces JSON Schema through each schema's own `toJSONSchema` method, so zod is a type-only import in core, and the core build now fails if any entry imports zod at load time. The zod peer dependency floor moves from `^4.0.0` to `^4.2.0`, the first release with that method; `@ironbird/cli` and the checkout example follow. CLI client commands such as `state`, `status`, `send`, and `wait` start faster because importing core no longer evaluates zod.
- 7cc72e8: First daemon and CLI: serve, status, commands, fakes, send, state, wait, settle, events, clock advance, clock now, reset. Headless entries load through esbuild with react-native import chains reported.
- 3408086: Pre-merge fixes for the M0 headless loop.
  
  - `EventRecorder` gains `lastSeq()`, an O(1) read of the latest sequence number.
  - The headless target bounds its factory with `bootTimeoutMs` (default 30 s) and reports every boot failure as `HEADLESS_LOAD_FAILED`, so a hanging or throwing factory can no longer wedge `run`, `reset`, or `dispose`. A read-only `settle` now fails promptly when a reset or dispose abandons it.
  - The daemon bounds each target operation with `requestTimeoutMs` (default 30 s), refuses requests that carry an `Origin` header or a foreign `Host` with 403, and answers unknown routes with `UNSUPPORTED`.
  - A config file that fails to load reports `INVALID_CONFIG` with `{ file, issues }`, and an unknown top-level key in `ironbird.config.ts` is now an error rather than being ignored.
  - A `serve` that fails to bind no longer deletes a running daemon's `.ironbird/daemon.json`.
  - `@ironbird/cli` no longer re-exports the unused `MUTATING_OPS`.
  - `createHeadlessTarget` accepts `entryPath`, reported as `details.entry` on boot failures; the daemon's request bound follows the operation's own timeout.
  - The published packages declare the MIT license and their repository directory, and each ships a `LICENSE` file.
